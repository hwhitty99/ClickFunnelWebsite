# CLick Funnel Website
For this university project I was instructed to create a three-page website that would either act as a portfolio/resume or market a good or service that I offer.
Since I already have a portfolio website, I went with the latter. I built the site to describe exactly what my [online clothing brand](https://lessthanthreeapparel.com/)
stands for and why the viewer should buy something from me. It definitely doesn't look like your standard click funnel site, but I think the purpose is similar. I designed
it to be descriptive but quick; easy to read but impactful; and to warrant an emotional response from the reader. I also made sure to keep my brand identity consistent with
the main website and my Instagram. I did this by using similar colors, fonts, and textures.

# What I Learned
- How to write my own HTML, CSS, and JS in VS Code and implement other developers's from CodePen, Stack Overflow, etc.
- How to use the power of Bootstrap CSS to make a responsive web design from desktop to mobile.
- How to animate multiple elements through CSS animations, jQuery, and smoothState
